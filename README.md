# 5.Public API Requests
 App for a fictional company called Awesome Startup </br>
 Many sites — Twitter, Facebook, IMDB, and Wikipedia to name a few — offer a vast sea of data that you can access and display on your own web pages. Using JavaScript, we have a employee directory by communicating with a third-party API (Application Programming Interface).</br>
 Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) was used to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.</br>

To display 12 random users and listen for a click on the employee card :

```bash
 function generateProfile(data)
```
To display the modal and listen for the close  button :
```bash
 function showModal(data)
```
